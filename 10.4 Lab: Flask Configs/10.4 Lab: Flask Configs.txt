-> Scaling Up: Configs, Application Factory, and Blueprints Lesson  
   -> Lab: Flask Configs  

-> Introduction to the Lab  
   -> If you haven't already cloned the Python Flask labs project and opened it in VS Code, please do so before starting this lab  
   -> The lab focuses on Flask app configuration, the application factory pattern, and blueprints for organising Flask applications  
   -> This is an important step in scaling up a Flask application for production-level development  

-> Learn by Doing  
   -> 1. Navigate to the labs project and open it in VS Code  
      -> This involves accessing the cloned project folder on your local machine and ensuring the environment is properly set up for Flask development  
   -> 2. Complete all the exercises in the folder  
      -> The exercises will guide you through key concepts such as configuring Flask apps, creating factories, and organising with blueprints  
      -> Ensure each task is completed thoroughly to gain hands-on experience with Flask configurations  
   -> 3. If you're subscribed to our membership or mentorship programmes, please feel free to reach out on Discord for a review or any help  
      -> Take advantage of support resources like Discord for feedback on your work or troubleshooting any issues you may encounter  
   -> 4. When you complete the labs, please be sure to push your work to GitHub  
      -> Version control is essential in software development. Ensure all code changes are committed and pushed to a remote GitHub repository  
      -> Pushing to GitHub helps you keep track of your progress, collaborate with others, and demonstrate your skills to potential employers or mentors  
   -> 5. This step is easily and often overlooked, but it is one of the most important  
      -> It's common to forget about version control, but pushing your work to GitHub regularly is a critical habit to form as a developer  
   -> 6. Version control and collaboration tools, most notably Git & GitHub, are used ubiquitously by all software engineers and engineering companies  
      -> Git is the industry-standard version control system, and GitHub provides a platform for collaboration and showcasing your work  
   -> 7. We advise that you do not skip it. Prove your work. Push it to GitHub. Get the practice, and get those GitHub Greens!  
      -> Getting familiar with GitHub will improve your software engineering workflow and increase your visibility in the developer community  
   -> 8. Looking at the two contribution graphs below, who would you hire?  
      -> The graphs represent GitHub contribution activity. It's important to consistently contribute to projects to demonstrate dedication and skill  

-> 10_scaling_up/01_blueprints_and_application_factory  
   -> This section introduces key concepts for scaling up a Flask app: blueprints and the application factory pattern  
   -> Blueprints allow you to modularise your application into components, while the application factory enables creating Flask app instances dynamically  
   -> Mastering these concepts is crucial when building larger Flask applications  

-> 13/12/2024, 16:06 Flask App Configuration Lab Assignment  
   -> The lab will walk you through the setup and configuration of a Flask application, including managing settings for different environments
