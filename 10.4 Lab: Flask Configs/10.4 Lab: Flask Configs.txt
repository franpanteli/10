-> scaling up: configs, application factory, and blueprints lesson
  -> lab: flask configs

-> introduction to the lab
  -> if you haven't already cloned the python flask labs project and opened it in vs code, please do so before starting this lab
  -> the lab focuses on flask app configuration, the application factory pattern, and blueprints for organising flask applications
  -> this is an important step in scaling up a flask application for production-level development

-> learn by doing
  -> 1. navigate to the labs project and open it in vs code
    -> this involves accessing the cloned project folder on your local machine and ensuring the environment is properly set up for flask development
  -> 2. complete all the exercises in the folder
    -> the exercises will guide you through key concepts such as configuring flask apps, creating factories, and organising with blueprints
    -> ensure each task is completed thoroughly to gain hands-on experience with flask configurations
  -> 3. if you're subscribed to our membership or mentorship programmes, please feel free to reach out on discord for a review or any help
    -> take advantage of support resources like discord for feedback on your work or troubleshooting any issues you may encounter
  -> 4. when you complete the labs, please be sure to push your work to github
    -> version control is essential in software development. ensure all code changes are committed and pushed to a remote github repository
    -> pushing to github helps you keep track of your progress, collaborate with others, and demonstrate your skills to potential employers or mentors
  -> 5. this step is easily and often overlooked, but it is one of the most important
    -> it's common to forget about version control, but pushing your work to github regularly is a critical habit to form as a developer
  -> 6. version control and collaboration tools, most notably git & github, are used ubiquitously by all software engineers and engineering companies
    -> git is the industry-standard version control system, and github provides a platform for collaboration and showcasing your work
  -> 7. we advise that you do not skip it. prove your work. push it to github. get the practice, and get those github greens!
    -> getting familiar with github will improve your software engineering workflow and increase your visibility in the developer community
  -> 8. looking at the two contribution graphs below, who would you hire?
    -> the graphs represent github contribution activity. it's important to consistently contribute to projects to demonstrate dedication and skill

-> 10_scaling_up/01_blueprints_and_application_factory
  -> this section introduces key concepts for scaling up a flask app: blueprints and the application factory pattern
  -> blueprints allow you to modularise your application into components, while the application factory enables creating flask app instances dynamically
  -> mastering these concepts is crucial when building larger flask applications

-> 13/12/2024, 16:06 flask app configuration lab assignment
  -> the lab will walk you through the setup and configuration of a flask application, including managing settings for different environments
  -> flask app configurations include settings for databases, debugging, sessions, etc., which you will configure in this lab
